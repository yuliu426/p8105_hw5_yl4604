The control arm's overal level is lower than experiment arm.

There is a uptrend in the experiment arm but no such trend in control arm.

when the effect size increases, the power also increases.

  output %>% 
    group_by(mu) %>% 
    summarise(mean_total = mean(mean))

null_rej = 
  output %>% 
  filter(test_result == 1) %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rej = mean(mean))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
combined_data = left_join(all_data, null_rej, by = 'mu')

combined_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(mean_total:mean_rej, names_to = 'total/rej', values_to ='mean_value' ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = mean_value, color = `total/rej`)) + geom_line(size = .4, alpha = 0.5)
```

comparing to sample average of all samples, the sample average of Î¼^ across tests for which the null is rejected are slightly bigger especially when true mean is relatively small. This is because the smaller the effect size, the small the power, so some false null hypothesis were filed to reject.
